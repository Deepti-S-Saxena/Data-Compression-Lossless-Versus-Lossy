# Data-Compression-Lossless-Versus-Lossy

Using Python (Jupyter) performed the following:
1. Performed Huffman coding to the two images respectively, and compared the coded bits length with their entropy
2. Performed Shannon coding to the two images respectively, and compared the coded bits length with their entropy
3. Performed Compressive Sensing to the two images, and plotted the decompressed images with different compression ratio.
4. Compared the above three approaches, Drawn Conclusion.
